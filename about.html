                    <p>I am a collaborative and solutions driven Full Stack Web Developer specializing in the MERN Stack with 
                        over ten years of technical experience in both QA Automation and Program Management. Effective at coupling 
                        creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving to develop effective solutions positively impacting the 
                        business and customer.</p>
        
                    <p>On a personal level, I have several passions that keep me busy outside of work and school. First and foremost, 
                        I have 2 young daughters who mean the world to me. We are a loving family filled with lots of laughter and lots of
                        love. When I'm not hanging with the family, I enjoy watching Sports. I especially love watching Baseball
                        and Basketball. Ever since I was a little kid growing up in the Bay Area, I have loved Baseball. My
                        Grandfather used to take my Brother and me up to SF to see the Giants or over to Oakland to see the
                        A's There's nothing better than going to a Baseball Game in Summer. Now that I'm grown and have a family, 
                        I get to share that passion with my girls who love going to Baseball Games.</p>
        
                    <p>I'm also an avid College Basketball Fan. I have split loyalties between the UW Huskies and UNC Tar Heels. 
                        While I was sad to see Coach Romar go, I think it was time. Sometimes you have to inject new blood to get 
                        things moving again. That's what UW has done with Coach Hop. In 2 short years, he's taken them from a 
                        completely irrelevant Team to the top of the Pac-12 Conference two years in a row. Most recently, they have 
                        ended an eight year drought of appearances in the NCAA Tournament. He's got a great recruiting class coming 
                        in for next year too!</p>
        
                    <p>I would love to bring my passion for quality and technology to your company. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
