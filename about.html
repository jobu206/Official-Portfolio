                    <p>Thank you for checking out my bio page. This is a place where I will continue to showcase my
                        Web Development skills. Over the past few years, I've been fortunate enough to work with some
                        very brilliant people who have inspired me to pursue my passion for Web Development. My journey took me
                        from working in the Mortgage Industry, to working as a Contractor at MS, to now being a Technical PM for
                        a Consulting Agency. My hope is that through the skills I learn, in this Bootcamp, I will find not only
                        a job but a career.</p>
        
                    <p>I have several passions that keep me busy outside of work and school. First and foremost, I have 2 young
                        daughters who mean the world to me. We are a loving family filled with lots of laughter and lots of
                        love. When I'm not hanging with the family, I enjoy watching Sports. I especially love watching Baseball
                        and Basketball. Ever since I was a little kid growing up in the Bay Area, I have loved Baseball. My
                        Grandfather used to take my Brother and me up to SF to see the Giants or A's There's nothing better than
                        going to a Baseball Game in Summer. Now that I'm grown and have a family, I get to share that passion
                        with my girls who love going to Baseball Games.</p>
        
                    <p>I'm also an avid College Basketball Fan. Love my UW Huskies and UNC Tar Heels. While I was sad to see
                        Coach Romar go, I think it was time. Sometimes you have to inject new blood to get things moving again.
                        That's what UW has done with Coach Hop. In 2 short years, he's taken them from a completely irrelevant
                        Team to the top of the Pac-12 Conference two years in a row. Most recently, they have ended an eight
                        year drought of appearances in the NCAA Tournament. He's got a great recruiting class coming in for next year
                        too!</p>
        
                    <p>My most favorite Team though, is UNC. I grew up watching the likes of Kenny Smith, Brad Daugherty, Jerry
                        Stackhouse, et al. One year for an early Birthday present, my wife bought us two tickets to NC to go
                        watch the Tar Heels play. Sadly I wasn't able to see them beat Duke but we got a win nonetheless! In
                        addition to the Tar Heels, I also enjoy watching the Huskies play Basketball. Each Summer, my Brother
                        and I take time during the week to go watch the local HS Kids and incoming Freshmen play Summer League
                        Ball. You really get to see some great Basketball!</p>
